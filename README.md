# Neapolis - TSW Project

This repository contains a web development project that showcases the main tourist attractions of Naples through a dynamic website.

The project was developed using PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and PostgreSQL as the backend database. It provides a simple but complete experience for both anonymous and registered users, including the ability to browse information and submit reviews.

## 🌍 Project Overview

The web application allows users to:

- View a homepage with featured tourist attractions in Naples.
- Access detailed pages for each attraction, including description, hours, prices, and location via Google Maps.
- Register and log in to leave reviews with star ratings.
- View and manage their user account.

The interface dynamically adapts based on login status, and data is securely managed via sessions and hashed credentials.
